        <p>This recipe is for a classic American double cheeseburger.</p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 hamburger bun, split</li>
            <li>1/3 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>2 American cheese singles</li>
            <li>1 leaf lettuce</li>
            <li>1 slice onion</li>
            <li>1 slice tomato</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a skillet over medium heat. Lightly toast both halves of the hamburger bun, cut sides down, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Separate beef into 2 portions and form each into a thin patty slightly larger than the bun. Lightly salt each patty and cook on one side for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip patties over and immediately place two slices of American cheese on each one. Cook until meat has reached desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Assemble the double cheeseburger in the following order: bottom bun, dressing, tomato, lettuce, beef patty with cheese, onion, beef patty with cheese, and top bun.</li>
        </ol>
